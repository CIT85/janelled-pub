        <h2>Common Comorbid Mood Disorders</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>

                <h3>Major Depressive Disorder</h3>
                <p>
                    Major depressive disorder is one of the most prevalent comorbidities in adults with ADHD. Adults
                    with ADHD are three times more likely to develop MDD compared to the general population12.
                    Approximately 70% of adults with ADHD will be treated for depression at some point in their lives4.

                <h3>Anxiety Disorders</h3>
                <p>
                    Anxiety disorders are another frequent comorbidity, with more than half of people with ADHD
                    experiencing an anxiety disorder such as social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or
                    post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The presence of anxiety can exacerbate ADHD symptoms and
                    vice versa, making proper diagnosis and treatment crucial.

                <h3>Dysthymia</h3>
                <p>
                    Adults with ADHD are six times more likely to develop dysthymia, a persistent depressive disorder
                    characterized by long-term (chronic) depression. This condition can significantly impact quality of
                    life and daily functioning.

                <h3>Bipolar Disorder</h3>
                <p>
                    Bipolar disorder, particularly bipolar I disorder, is another common comorbidity with ADHD. Studies
                    have reported that roughly 5-7% of people with ADHD also have bipolar disorder. The comorbidity
                    rates of ADHD in individuals with bipolar disorder range from 9.5% to 21.2%.
                </p>
                <h3>Increased Severity:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Patients with comorbid ADHD-BD experience:
                    More depressive, mixed, hypomanic, and total mood episodes.
                    Shorter periods of wellness.
                    Higher instances of additional comorbid conditions, including anxiety and substance use disorders.
